          You&apos;ll also have the option to upload a delayed reveal image if
          you wish to use one. Next, you&apos;ll link your contract to the
          relevant NFT projectâ€”whether it&apos;s a 1-of-1 collection or a
          generative collection you created earlier. Once linked, NFTs minted
          via this contract will originate from the associated project.

        <p className="text-gray-300">
          After uploading both the delayed reveal image and the final NFTs, you
          can preview how the minting experience will appear to users. A
          dedicated section allows you to configure whitelist settings, such as
          setting a whitelist price and defining the maximum number of NFTs an
          individual can mint during the whitelist phase.

        <p className="text-gray-300">
          Once all the details are complete, click Save to finalize the setup.
          You&apos;ll then have the opportunity to review the contract and
          proceed to deployment on the blockchain.
